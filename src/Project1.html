								    <p>The point of this app was to teach me how to incorporate Java, CSS, and HTML together. Through this project, I was able to establish the skills that I learned from making the website and apply them to a standard form of coding. </p>
								    <p>My goal for this project was to see if I was able to create a new website and try my hand at full-stack development. I do recognize that this is not a full-stack project, as the front end of the project is just HTML and CSS, while the backend was just Java. However, I wanted to learn how the two interacted with each other.</p>
									<p>From this, I learned many things. One of which is that javascript has a way better functionality for this project. In fact, I realize that I could make the whole program with just html and javascript. The second thing is that, in order for this program to run correctly, the user needs to have my Java program running in the background and run the HTML website from this local device. Otherwise, the program will not be working. Unfortunately, I do not have the resources to pay for a server to be running my programs on a website, so this was inevitably a bust. However, I do plan on making a fully functional website that uses both front-end and back-endz styles of programming. </p>
