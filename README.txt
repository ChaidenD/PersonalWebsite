This website is purely to showcase my current projects and who I am as a person.
I wanted to show what I do on my off time in both relaxing, working, and what future 
I am trying to pusue. I expect this website to continuously change as I change. 
Instead of this being a website, I consider this to be a personal archive of my 
development process. As I continue to learn and grow, so should this website. 

Thank you for your time.
